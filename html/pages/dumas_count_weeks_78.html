			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 79. The Lemonade</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Morrel was, in fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab-horse. He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Morrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him as he best might. Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age; Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion. These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him—a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On arriving at the house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.4</span><span class="cts_passage">The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine. She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress, and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.5</span><span class="cts_passage">But the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor, and he soon made his appearance in the room. Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himself—an intervention which had saved them from despair. Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him. Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak. Noirtier fixed his eyes on her.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“Am I to say what you told me?” asked Valentine. Noirtier made a sign that she was to do so.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Morrel,” said Valentine to the young man, who was regarding her with the most intense interest, “my grandfather, M. Noirtier, had a thousand things to say, which he told me three days ago; and now, he has sent for you, that I may repeat them to you. I will repeat them, then; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter, I will be faithful to the trust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, I am listening with the greatest impatience,” replied the young man; “speak, I beg of you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Valentine cast down her eyes; this was a good omen for Morrel, for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming Valentine.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“My grandfather intends leaving this house,” said she, “and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“But you, Mademoiselle de Villefort,—you, who are necessary to M. Noirtier’s happiness——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“I?” interrupted Valentine; “I shall not leave my grandfather,—that is an understood thing between us. My apartment will be close to his. Now, M. de Villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal; in the first case, I shall leave directly, and in the second, I shall wait till I am of age, which will be in about ten months. Then I shall be free, I shall have an independent fortune, and”—</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what?” demanded Morrel.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“And with my grandfather’s consent I shall fulfil the promise which I have made you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone, that nothing but Morrel’s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?” said Valentine, addressing Noirtier.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” looked the old man.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Once under my grandfather’s roof, M. Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness; in that case I shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands. But, alas, I have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; I trust we shall never find it so in our experience!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh,” cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before Noirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior beings, “what have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Until that time,” continued the young girl in a calm and self-possessed tone of voice, “we will conform to circumstances, and be guided by the wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it expresses all I wish to convey,—we will wait.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes, sir,” said Morrel, “not only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Therefore,” continued Valentine, looking playfully at Maximilian, “no more inconsiderate actions—no more rash projects; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Morrel looked obedience to her commands. Noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness, while Barrois, who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed, smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“How hot you look, my good Barrois,” said Valentine.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M. Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter, on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass. The decanter was nearly full, with the exception of a little, which had been already drunk by M. Noirtier.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, Barrois,” said the young girl, “take some of this lemonade; I see you are coveting a good draught of it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“The fact is, mademoiselle,” said Barrois, “I am dying with thirst, and since you are so kind as to offer it me, I cannot say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take some, then, and come back immediately.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Barrois took away the waiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which in his haste he forgot to shut, than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled. Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the door-bell. It was the signal of a visit. Valentine looked at her watch.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is past noon,” said she, “and today is Saturday; I dare say it is the doctor, grandpapa.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.32</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“He will come in here, and M. Morrel had better go,—do you not think so, grandpapa?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” signed the old man.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Barrois,” cried Valentine, “Barrois!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am coming, mademoiselle,” replied he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“Barrois will open the door for you,” said Valentine, addressing Morrel. “And now remember one thing, Monsieur Officer, that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill-advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“I promised him to wait,” replied Morrel; “and I will wait.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.39</span><span class="cts_passage">At this moment Barrois entered. “Who rang?” asked Valentine.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Doctor d’Avrigny,” said Barrois, staggering as if he would fall.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the matter, Barrois?” said Valentine. The old man did not answer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is going to fall!” cried Morrel.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.43</span><span class="cts_passage">The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features of the face became quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man. Barrois made some steps towards his master.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, sir,” said he, “tell me what is the matter with me. I am suffering—I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain. Ah, don’t touch me, pray don’t.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.45</span><span class="cts_passage">By this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets; his head fell back, and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen. Valentine uttered a cry of horror; Morrel took her in his arms, as if to defend her from some unknown danger.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“M. d’Avrigny, M. d’Avrigny,” cried she, in a stifled voice. “Help, help!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.47</span><span class="cts_passage">Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps, then fell at the feet of Noirtier, and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid, exclaimed:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“My master, my good master!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.49</span><span class="cts_passage">At this moment M. de Villefort, attracted by the noise, appeared on the threshold. Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine, and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain. Pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic, whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant. One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye, trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.51</span><span class="cts_passage">Barrois, his features convulsed, his eyes suffused with blood, and his head thrown back, was lying at full length, beating the floor with his hands, while his legs had become so stiff, that they looked as if they would break rather than bend. A slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth, and he breathed painfully, and with extreme difficulty.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.52</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment, and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word. He had not seen Morrel. After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards the door, crying out:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“Doctor, doctor! come instantly, pray come!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame, madame!” cried Valentine, calling her step-mother, and running upstairs to meet her; “come quick, quick!—and bring your bottle of smelling-salts with you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the matter?” said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and constrained tone.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh! come! come!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“But where is the doctor?” exclaimed Villefort; “where is he?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.58</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame de Villefort now deliberately descended the staircase. In one hand she held her handkerchief, with which she appeared to be wiping her face, and in the other a bottle of English smelling-salts. Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier, whose face, independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing, proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health; her second glance was at the dying man. She turned pale, and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the name of heaven, madame,” said Villefort, “where is the doctor? He was with you just now. You see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he might be saved if he could but be bled!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“Has he eaten anything lately?” asked Madame de Villefort, eluding her husband’s question.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame,” replied Valentine, “he has not even breakfasted. He has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him, and when he returned, took nothing but a glass of lemonade.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” said Madame de Villefort, “why did he not take wine? Lemonade was a very bad thing for him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“Grandpapa’s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor Barrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could find.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.64</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame de Villefort started. Noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“He has such a short neck,” said she.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame,” said Villefort, “I ask where is M. d’Avrigny? In God’s name answer me!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is with Edward, who is not quite well,” replied Madame de Villefort, no longer being able to avoid answering.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.68</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take this,” said Madame de Villefort, giving her smelling-bottle to Valentine. “They will, no doubt, bleed him; therefore I will retire, for I cannot endure the sight of blood;” and she followed her husband upstairs. Morrel now emerged from his hiding-place, where he had remained quite unperceived, so great had been the general confusion.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go away as quick as you can, Maximilian,” said Valentine, “and stay till I send for you. Go.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.71</span><span class="cts_passage">Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire. The old man, who had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so. The young man pressed Valentine’s hand to his lips, and then left the house by a back staircase.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.72</span><span class="cts_passage">At the same moment that he quitted the room, Villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door. Barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness. The risis seemed past, a low moaning was heard, and he raised himself on one knee. D’Avrigny and Villefort laid him on a couch.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you prescribe, doctor?” demanded Villefort.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“Give me some water and ether. You have some in the house, have you not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.77</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort immediately despatched a messenger. “And now let everyone retire.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Must I go too?” asked Valentine timidly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, mademoiselle, you especially,” replied the doctor abruptly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.80</span><span class="cts_passage">Valentine looked at M. d’Avrigny with astonishment, kissed her grandfather on the forehead, and left the room. The doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“Look, look, doctor,” said Villefort, “he is quite coming round again; I really do not think, after all, it is anything of consequence.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.82</span><span class="cts_passage">M. d’Avrigny answered by a melancholy smile.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.83</span><span class="cts_passage">“How do you feel, Barrois?” asked he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“A little better, sir.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will you drink some of this ether and water?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will try; but don’t touch me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.87</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“Drink.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.90</span><span class="cts_passage">Barrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about half of the liquid offered him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.91</span><span class="cts_passage">“Where do you suffer?” asked the doctor.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“Everywhere. I feel cramps over my whole body.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.93</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.95</span><span class="cts_passage">“Any noise in the ears?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“Frightful.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“When did you first feel that?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.98</span><span class="cts_passage">“Just now.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“Suddenly?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.100</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, like a clap of thunder.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.101</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.102</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“No drowsiness?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.104</span><span class="cts_passage">“None.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.105</span><span class="cts_passage">“What have you eaten today?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master’s lemonade—that’s all.” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who, immovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.107</span><span class="cts_passage">“Where is this lemonade?” asked the doctor eagerly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.108</span><span class="cts_passage">“Downstairs in the decanter.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.109</span><span class="cts_passage">“Whereabouts downstairs?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the kitchen.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.111</span><span class="cts_passage">“Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?” inquired Villefort.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.113</span><span class="cts_passage">D’Avrigny bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself going down to the kitchen. She cried out, but d’Avrigny paid no attention to her; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with a bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left. He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey. Panting with loss of breath, he returned to the room he had just left. Madame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.114</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is this the decanter you spoke of?” asked d’Avrigny.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.115</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, doctor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.117</span><span class="cts_passage">“I believe so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.118</span><span class="cts_passage">“What did it taste like?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.119</span><span class="cts_passage">“It had a bitter taste.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.120</span><span class="cts_passage">The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand, put his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is no doubt the same,” said he. “Did you drink some too, M. Noirtier?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.122</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“And did you also discover a bitter taste?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.124</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, doctor,” cried Barrois, “the fit is coming on again. Oh, do something for me.” The doctor flew to his patient.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“That emetic, Villefort—see if it is coming.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.127</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort sprang into the passage, exclaiming, “The emetic! the emetic!—is it come yet?” No one answered. The most profound terror reigned throughout the house.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.128</span><span class="cts_passage">“If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,” said d’Avrigny, looking around him, “perhaps I might prevent suffocation. But there is nothing which would do!—nothing!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.129</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, sir,” cried Barrois, “are you going to let me die without help? Oh, I am dying! Oh, save me!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.130</span><span class="cts_passage">“A pen, a pen!” said the doctor. There was one lying on the table; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who, in the midst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. This second attack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor left him in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and, going up to Noirtier, said abruptly:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.131</span><span class="cts_passage">“How do you find yourself?—well?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.132</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.133</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and comfortable—eh?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.134</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.135</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.136</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.137</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did Barrois make your lemonade?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.138</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.139</span><span class="cts_passage">“Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.140</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.141</span><span class="cts_passage">“Was it M. de Villefort?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.142</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.143</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.144</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.145</span><span class="cts_passage">“It was your granddaughter, then, was it not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.146</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.147</span><span class="cts_passage">A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d’Avrigny; he left M. Noirtier, and returned to the sick man.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.148</span><span class="cts_passage">“Barrois,” said the doctor, “can you speak?” Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words. “Try and make an effort to do so, my good man.” said d’Avrigny. Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.149</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who made the lemonade?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.150</span><span class="cts_passage">“I did.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.151</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.152</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.153</span><span class="cts_passage">“You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.154</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.155</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who brought it into this room, then?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.156</span><span class="cts_passage">“Mademoiselle Valentine.” D’Avrigny struck his forehead with his hand.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.157</span><span class="cts_passage">“Gracious heaven,” exclaimed he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.158</span><span class="cts_passage">“Doctor, doctor!” cried Barrois, who felt another fit coming.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.159</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will they never bring that emetic?” asked the doctor.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.160</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here is a glass with one already prepared,” said Villefort, entering the room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.161</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who prepared it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.162</span><span class="cts_passage">“The chemist who came here with me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.163</span><span class="cts_passage">“Drink it,” said the doctor to Barrois.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.164</span><span class="cts_passage">“Impossible, doctor; it is too late; my throat is closing up. I am choking! Oh, my heart! Ah, my head!—Oh, what agony!—Shall I suffer like this long?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.165</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, no, friend,” replied the doctor, “you will soon cease to suffer.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.166</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, I understand you,” said the unhappy man. “My God, have mercy upon me!” and, uttering a fearful cry, Barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning. D’Avrigny put his hand to his heart, and placed a glass before his lips.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.167</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well?” said Villefort.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.168</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.169</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort went immediately.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.170</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not be alarmed, M. Noirtier,” said d’Avrigny; “I am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him; this sort of attack is very frightful to witness.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.171</span><span class="cts_passage">And taking Barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining room; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade. Noirtier closed his right eye.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.172</span><span class="cts_passage">“You want Valentine, do you not? I will tell them to send her to you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.173</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort returned, and d’Avrigny met him in the passage.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.174</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, how is he now?” asked he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.175</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come in here,” said d’Avrigny, and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.176</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is he still in a fit?” said the procureur.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.177</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is dead.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.178</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort drew back a few steps, and, clasping his hands, exclaimed, with real amazement and sympathy, “Dead?—and so soon too!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.179</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, it is very soon,” said the doctor, looking at the corpse before him; “but that ought not to astonish you; Monsieur and Madame de Saint-Méran died as soon. People die very suddenly in your house, M. de Villefort.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.180</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” cried the magistrate, with an accent of horror and consternation, “are you still harping on that terrible idea?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.181</span><span class="cts_passage">“Still, sir; and I shall always do so,” replied d’Avrigny, “for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind; and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen well to what I am going to say, M. de Villefort.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.182</span><span class="cts_passage">The magistrate trembled convulsively.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.183</span><span class="cts_passage">“There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces. I know it well; I have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces. I recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de Saint-Méran. There is a way of detecting its presence. It restores the blue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns syrup of violets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come with the syrup of violets.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.184</span><span class="cts_passage">The doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. M. d’Avrigny opened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed the door.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.185</span><span class="cts_passage">“Look,” said he to the procureur, whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard, “here is in this cup some syrup of violets, and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook. If the lemonade be pure and inoffensive, the syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the lemonade be drugged with poison, the syrup will become green. Look closely!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.186</span><span class="cts_passage">The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade, then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal to emerald. Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.187</span><span class="cts_passage">“The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,” said d’Avrigny, “and I will maintain this assertion before God and man.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79.188</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard eyes, and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.</span></div></div>
