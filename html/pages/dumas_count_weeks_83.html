			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 84. Beauchamp</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight. The dying man had signed a deposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin. The police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer. Caderousse’s knife, dark lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was conveyed to the morgue. The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil, and that he only knew what was related by the Abbé Busoni, who that evening, by mere chance, had requested to pass the night in his house, to examine some valuable books in his library.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto’s name was mentioned in his presence, but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Villefort, being called on to prove the crime, was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.5</span><span class="cts_passage">But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker’s as the betrothed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Letters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count’s father, who highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres. It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti; not so Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars. With an instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea’s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she betrayed an entire dislike to him. The baron might possibly have perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired. Morcerf appreciated the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord. No one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of Peers.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.9</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert, however, felt no less insulted; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult. Besides, the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart. He cherished the thought of the duel, hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds. Beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited Albert, and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days. Where he was no one knew.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.10</span><span class="cts_passage">One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced Beauchamp. Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking-room on the ground floor, dressed himself quickly, and went down.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.11</span><span class="cts_passage">He found Beauchamp pacing the room; on perceiving him Beauchamp stopped.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your arrival here, without waiting my visit at your house today, looks well, sir,” said Albert. “Tell me, may I shake hands with you, saying, ‘Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured me, and retain my friendship,’ or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“Albert,” said Beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man, “let us first sit down and talk.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“Rather, sir, before we sit down, I must demand your answer.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Albert,” said the journalist, “these are questions which it is difficult to answer.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will facilitate it by repeating the question, ‘Will you, or will you not, retract?’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Morcerf, it is not enough to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to questions which concern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man as Lieutenant-général the Count of Morcerf, peer of France.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“What must then be done?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“What I have done, Albert. I reasoned thus—money, time, and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family; probabilities will not suffice, only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend. If I strike with the sword, or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom, for three years, I have been on terms of intimacy, I must, at least, know why I do so; I must meet him with a heart at ease, and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Morcerf, impatiently, “what does all this mean?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“It means that I have just returned from Yanina.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“From Yanina?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Impossible!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here is my passport; examine the visa—Geneva, Milan, Venice, Trieste, Delvino, Yanina. Will you believe the government of a republic, a kingdom, and an empire?” Albert cast his eyes on the passport, then raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have been to Yanina?” said he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Albert, had you been a stranger, a foreigner, a simple lord, like that Englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since, and whom I killed to get rid of, I should not have taken this trouble; but I thought this mark of consideration due to you. I took a week to go, another to return, four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours to stay there; that makes three weeks. I returned last night, and here I am.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“What circumlocution! How long you are before you tell me what I most wish to know?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because, in truth, Albert——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“You hesitate?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,—I fear.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you? Oh, no self-love, Beauchamp. Acknowledge it, Beauchamp; your courage cannot be doubted.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not so,” murmured the journalist; “on the contrary——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert turned frightfully pale; he endeavored to speak, but the words died on his lips.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“My friend,” said Beauchamp, in the most affectionate tone, “I should gladly make an apology; but, alas!——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“But what?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“The paragraph was correct, my friend.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“What? That French officer——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fernand?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Pardon me, my friend, that man was your father!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.44</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert advanced furiously towards Beauchamp, but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“My friend,” said he, “here is a proof of it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.46</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of Yanina, proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego, in the service of Ali Tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million crowns. The signatures were perfectly legal. Albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair. It could no longer be doubted; the family name was fully given. After a moment’s mournful silence, his heart overflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears. Beauchamp, who had watched with sincere pity the young man’s paroxysm of grief, approached him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now, Albert,” said he, “you understand me—do you not? I wished to see all, and to judge of everything for myself, hoping the explanation would be in your father’s favor, and that I might do him justice. But, on the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that Fernand Mondego, raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no other than Count Fernand of Morcerf; then, recollecting the honor you had done me, in admitting me to your friendship, I hastened to you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.48</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert, still extended on the chair, covered his face with both hands, as if to prevent the light from reaching him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“I hastened to you,” continued Beauchamp, “to tell you, Albert, that in this changing age, the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children. Few have passed through this revolutionary period, in the midst of which we were born, without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier, or the gown of the magistrate. Now I have these proofs, Albert, and I am in your confidence, no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal, but I come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me. Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed? Do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us? Confided to me, it shall never escape my lips; say, Albert, my friend, do you wish it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert threw himself on Beauchamp’s neck.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, noble fellow!” cried he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take these,” said Beauchamp, presenting the papers to Albert.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.53</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert seized them with a convulsive hand, tore them in pieces, and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him, he approached the wax-light, always kept burning for cigars, and burned every fragment.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Dear, excellent friend,” murmured Albert, still burning the papers.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream,” said Beauchamp; “let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper, and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, yes,” said Albert, “and may there remain only the eternal friendship which I promised to my deliverer, which shall be transmitted to our children’s children, and shall always remind me that I owe my life and the honor of my name to you,—for had this been known, oh, Beauchamp, I should have destroyed myself; or,—no, my poor mother! I could not have killed her by the same blow,—I should have fled from my country.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Dear Albert,” said Beauchamp. But this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man, and was succeeded by a still greater grief.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Beauchamp, “what still oppresses you, my friend?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am broken-hearted,” said Albert. “Listen, Beauchamp! I cannot thus, in a moment relinquish the respect, the confidence, and pride with which a father’s untarnished name inspires a son. Oh, Beauchamp, Beauchamp, how shall I now approach mine? Shall I draw back my forehead from his embrace, or withhold my hand from his? I am the most wretched of men. Ah, my mother, my poor mother!” said Albert, gazing through his tears at his mother’s portrait; “if you know this, how much must you suffer!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come,” said Beauchamp, taking both his hands, “take courage, my friend.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal? Some unknown enemy—an invisible foe—has done this.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“The more must you fortify yourself, Albert. Let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance, bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death—a fatal secret, known only when the storm bursts. Go, my friend, reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“You think, then, all is not over yet?” said Albert, horror-stricken.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“I think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible. By the way——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?” said Albert, seeing that Beauchamp hesitated.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why do you ask me now?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“How?” said Albert, whose brow reddened; “you think M. Danglars——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“I ask you only how your engagement stands? Pray put no construction on my words I do not mean they should convey, and give them no undue weight.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.” said Albert, “the engagement is broken off.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Beauchamp. Then, seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy, “Let us go out, Albert,” said he; “a ride in the wood in the phaeton, or on horseback, will refresh you; we will then return to breakfast, and you shall attend to your affairs, and I to mine.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“Willingly,” said Albert; “but let us walk. I think a little exertion would do me good.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.74</span><span class="cts_passage">The two friends walked out on the fortress. When they arrived at the Madeleine:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Since we are out,” said Beauchamp, “let us call on M. de Monte Cristo; he is admirably adapted to revive one’s spirits, because he never interrogates, and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">84.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Gladly,” said Albert; “let us call—I love him.”</span></div></div>
