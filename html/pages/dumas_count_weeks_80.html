			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 81. The Room of the Retired Baker</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars’ house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, moustaches in perfect order, and white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered the courtyard of the banker’s house in Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin. He had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing-room before he drew Danglars aside into the recess of a bow-window, and, after an ingenious preamble, related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father’s departure. He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker’s family, in which he had been received as a son, and where, besides, his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.3</span><span class="cts_passage">Danglars listened with the most profound attention; he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days, and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to Morcerf. He would not, however, yield immediately to the young man’s request, but made a few conscientious objections.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you not rather young, M. Andrea, to think of marrying?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“I think not, sir,” replied M. Cavalcanti; “in Italy the nobility generally marry young. Life is so uncertain, that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, sir,” said Danglars, “in case your proposals, which do me honor, are accepted by my wife and daughter, by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled? So important a negotiation should, I think, be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir, my father is a man of great foresight and prudence. Thinking that I might wish to settle in France, he left me at his departure, together with the papers establishing my identity, a letter promising, if he approved of my choice, 150,000 livres per annum from the day I was married. So far as I can judge, I suppose this to be a quarter of my father’s revenue.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“I,” said Danglars, “have always intended giving my daughter 500,000 francs as her dowry; she is, besides, my sole heiress.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing. We should command an annuity of 175,000 livres. Supposing, also, I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is not likely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three millions in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per cent.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“I never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and a half; but to my son-in-law I would give five, and we would share the profits.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Very good, father-in-law,” said Cavalcanti, yielding to his low-born nature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it. Correcting himself immediately, he said, “Excuse me, sir; hope alone makes me almost mad,—what will not reality do?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“But,” said Danglars, who, on his part, did not perceive how soon the conversation, which was at first disinterested, was turning to a business transaction, “there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“Which?” asked the young man.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“That you inherit from your mother.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Truly, from my mother, Leonora Corsinari.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“How much may it amount to?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed, sir,” said Andrea, “I assure you I have never given the subject a thought, but I suppose it must have been at least two millions.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure, or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, sir,” said Andrea, bowing to the banker respectfully, “may I hope?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“You may not only hope,” said Danglars, “but consider it a settled thing, if no obstacle arises on your part.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am, indeed, rejoiced,” said Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“But,” said Danglars thoughtfully, “how is it that your patron, M. de Monte Cristo, did not make his proposal for you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea blushed imperceptibly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have just left the count, sir,” said he; “he is, doubtless, a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas. He esteems me highly. He even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property. He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another, and he never would. I must, however, do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion, because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one. Besides, if he will do nothing officially, he will answer any questions you propose to him. And now,” continued he, with one of his most charming smiles, “having finished talking to the father-in-law, I must address myself to the banker.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what may you have to say to him?” said Danglars, laughing in his turn.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs; but the count, expecting my bachelor’s revenue could not suffice for the coming month’s outlay, has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs. It bears his signature, as you see, which is all-sufficient.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bring me a million such as that,” said Danglars, “I shall be well pleased,” putting the draft in his pocket. “Fix your own hour for tomorrow, and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“At ten o’clock then, if you please; I should like it early, as I am going into the country tomorrow.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Very well, at ten o’clock; you are still at the Hôtel des Princes?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.31</span><span class="cts_passage">The following morning, with the banker’s usual punctuality, the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man’s hands, as he was on the point of starting, after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse. He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and returned as late as possible in the evening.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.32</span><span class="cts_passage">But scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” said he, “that man has been here.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“What man?” said Andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh,” said Andrea, “my father’s old servant. Well, you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, your excellency.” Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed. “But,” continued the porter, “he would not take them.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.38</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea turned pale, but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible. “What? he would not take them?” said he with slight emotion.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, he wished to speak to your excellency; I told him you were gone out, and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter, which he had brought with him already sealed.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Give it me,” said Andrea, and he read by the light of his carriage-lamp:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“‘You know where I live; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.42</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea examined it carefully, to ascertain if the letter had been opened, or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so carefully folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was perfect.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Very well,” said he. “Poor man, he is a worthy creature.” He left the porter to ponder on these words, not knowing which most to admire, the master or the servant.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take out the horses quickly, and come up to me,” said Andrea to his groom. In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousse’s letter. The servant entered just as he had finished.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are about my height, Pierre,” said he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have that honor, your excellency.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“You had a new livery yesterday?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening, and do not wish to be known; lend me your livery till tomorrow. I may sleep, perhaps, at an inn.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Pierre obeyed. Five minutes after, Andrea left the hotel, completely disguised, took a cabriolet, and ordered the driver to take him to the Cheval Rouge, at Picpus. The next morning he left that inn as he had left the Hôtel des Princes, without being noticed, walked down the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, along the boulevard to Rue Ménilmontant, and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter’s absence.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?” asked the fruiteress on the opposite side.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur Pailletin, if you please, my good woman,” replied Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“A retired baker?” asked the fruiteress.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Exactly.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“He lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.56</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a hare’s paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he pulled with considerable ill-temper. A moment after Caderousse’s face appeared at the grating in the door.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! you are punctual,” said he, as he drew back the door.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“Confound you and your punctuality!” said Andrea, throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, come, my little fellow, don’t be angry. See, I have thought about you—look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what you are fond of.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.60</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to Provençal kitchens of an inferior order, added to that of dried fish, and above all, the pungent smell of musk and cloves. These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot. In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the other with yellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of fruit in a cabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you think of it, my little fellow?” said Caderousse. “Ay, that smells good! You know I used to be a good cook; do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers? You were among the first who tasted any of my dishes, and I think you relished them tolerably.” While speaking, Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“But,” said Andrea, ill-temperedly, “by my faith, if it was only to breakfast with you, that you disturbed me, I wish the devil had taken you!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“My boy,” said Caderousse sententiously, “one can talk while eating. And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend? I am weeping with joy.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.64</span><span class="cts_passage">He was truly crying, but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the Pont-du-Gard.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“Hold your tongue, hypocrite,” said Andrea; “you love me!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, I do, or may the devil take me. I know it is a weakness,” said Caderousse, “but it overpowers me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come,” said Caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron, “if I did not like you, do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead me? Think for a moment. You have your servant’s clothes on—you therefore keep a servant; I have none, and am obliged to prepare my own meals. You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d’hôte of the Hôtel des Princes, or the Café de Paris. Well, I too could keep a servant; I too could have a tilbury; I too could dine where I like; but why do I not? Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto. Come, just acknowledge that I could, eh?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.69</span><span class="cts_passage">This address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Andrea, “admitting your love, why do you want me to breakfast with you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“That I may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“Eh, dear friend,” said Caderousse, “are wills ever made without codicils? But you first came to breakfast, did you not? Well, sit down, and let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which I have put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. Ah, yes; you look at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each. But what do you expect? This is not the Hôtel des Princes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you, who only wish to live like a retired baker.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.75</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse sighed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, what have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“I can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor Benedetto, is rich—he has an annuity.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, you have an annuity.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, since I bring you your two hundred francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.81</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse shrugged his shoulders.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.82</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is humiliating,” said he, “thus to receive money given grudgingly,—an uncertain supply which may soon fail. You see I am obliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease. Well, my friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said. I know your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to marry the daughter of Danglars.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.83</span><span class="cts_passage">“What? of Danglars?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, to be sure; must I say Baron Danglars? I might as well say Count Benedetto. He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine. Yes, yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,—he was an under-clerk to the good M. Morrel. I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying. Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the great gate, introduce myself. Meanwhile let us sit down and eat.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.87</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. The latter seemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, mate,” said Caderousse, “you are getting on better terms with your old landlord!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“Faith, yes,” replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.90</span><span class="cts_passage">“So you like it, you rogue?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.91</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you see,” said Caderousse, “all my happiness is marred by one thought?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.93</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is that?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“That I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.95</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not let that disturb you, I have enough for two.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month I am tormented by remorse.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“Good Caderousse!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.98</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.100</span><span class="cts_passage">“True remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.101</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea shuddered; he always did so at Caderousse’s ideas.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.102</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is miserable—do you see?—always to wait till the end of the month.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh,” said Andrea philosophically, determined to watch his companion narrowly, “does not life pass in waiting? Do I, for instance, fare better? Well, I wait patiently, do I not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.104</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs, you expect five or six thousand, perhaps ten, perhaps even twelve, for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost. Down there, you always had little presents and Christmas-boxes, which you tried to hide from your poor friend Caderousse. Fortunately he is a cunning fellow, that friend Caderousse.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.105</span><span class="cts_passage">“There you are beginning again to ramble, to talk again and again of the past! But what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again?”</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.107</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.108</span><span class="cts_passage">“I was going to say, if I were in your place——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.109</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“I would realize——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.111</span><span class="cts_passage">“How would you realize?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“I would ask for six months’ in advance, under pretence of being able to purchase a farm, then with my six months I would decamp.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.113</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, well,” said Andrea, “that isn’t a bad idea.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.114</span><span class="cts_passage">“My dear friend,” said Caderousse, “eat of my bread, and take my advice; you will be none the worse off, physically or morally.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.115</span><span class="cts_passage">“But,” said Andrea, “why do you not act on the advice you gave me? Why do you not realize a six months’, a year’s advance even, and retire to Brussels? Instead of living the retired baker, you might live as a bankrupt, using his privileges; that would be very good.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.117</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, Caderousse,” said Andrea, “how covetous you are! Two months ago you were dying with hunger.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.118</span><span class="cts_passage">“The appetite grows by what it feeds on,” said Caderousse, grinning and showing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. “And,” added he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread, “I have formed a plan.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.119</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse’s plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas; ideas were but the germ, the plan was reality.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.120</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let me see your plan; I dare say it is a pretty one.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why not? Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of M——! eh? was it not I? and it was no bad one I believe, since here we are!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.122</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not say,” replied Andrea, “that you never make a good one; but let us see your plan.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” pursued Caderousse, “can you without expending one sou, put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs? No, fifteen thousand are not enough,—I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.124</span><span class="cts_passage">“No,” replied Andrea, dryly, “no, I cannot.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not think you understand me,” replied Caderousse, calmly; “I said without your laying out a sou.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune—and yours with mine—and both of us to be dragged down there again?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.127</span><span class="cts_passage">“It would make very little difference to me,” said Caderousse, “if I were retaken, I am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad never to see them again.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.128</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea did more than tremble this time, he turned pale.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.129</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, Caderousse, no nonsense!” said he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.130</span><span class="cts_passage">“Don’t alarm yourself, my little Benedetto, but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance, and I will contrive it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.131</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I’ll see—I’ll try to contrive some way,” said Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.132</span><span class="cts_passage">“Meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs, my little fellow? I have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.133</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, you shall have your five hundred francs,” said Andrea; “but it is very hard for me, my poor Caderousse—you take advantage——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.134</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bah,” said Caderousse, “when you have access to countless stores.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.135</span><span class="cts_passage">One would have said Andrea anticipated his companion’s words, so did his eye flash like lightning, but it was but for a moment.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.136</span><span class="cts_passage">“True,” he replied, “and my protector is very kind.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.137</span><span class="cts_passage">“That dear protector,” said Caderousse; “and how much does he give you monthly?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.138</span><span class="cts_passage">“Five thousand francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.139</span><span class="cts_passage">“As many thousands as you give me hundreds! Truly, it is only bastards who are thus fortunate. Five thousand francs per month! What the devil can you do with all that?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.140</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, it is no trouble to spend that; and I am like you, I want capital.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.141</span><span class="cts_passage">“Capital?—yes—I understand—everyone would like capital.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.142</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, and I shall get it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.143</span><span class="cts_passage">“Who will give it to you—your prince?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.144</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, my prince. But unfortunately I must wait.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.145</span><span class="cts_passage">“You must wait for what?” asked Caderousse.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.146</span><span class="cts_passage">“For his death.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.147</span><span class="cts_passage">“The death of your prince?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.148</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.149</span><span class="cts_passage">“How so?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.150</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because he has made his will in my favor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.151</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.152</span><span class="cts_passage">“On my honor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.153</span><span class="cts_passage">“For how much?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.154</span><span class="cts_passage">“For five hundred thousand.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.155</span><span class="cts_passage">“Only that? It’s little enough.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.156</span><span class="cts_passage">“But so it is.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.157</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, it cannot be!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.158</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you my friend, Caderousse?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.159</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, in life or death.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.160</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I will tell you a secret.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.161</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.162</span><span class="cts_passage">“But remember——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.163</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! _pardieu!_ mute as a carp.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.164</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I think——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.165</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea stopped and looked around.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.166</span><span class="cts_passage">“You think? Do not fear; _pardieu!_ we are alone.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.167</span><span class="cts_passage">“I think I have discovered my father.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.168</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your true father?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.169</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.170</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not old Cavalcanti?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.171</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, for he has gone again; the true one, as you say.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.172</span><span class="cts_passage">“And that father is——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.173</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, Caderousse, it is Monte Cristo.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.174</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bah!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.175</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, you understand, that explains all. He cannot acknowledge me openly, it appears, but he does it through M. Cavalcanti, and gives him fifty thousand francs for it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.176</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fifty thousand francs for being your father? I would have done it for half that, for twenty thousand, for fifteen thousand; why did you not think of me, ungrateful man?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.177</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did I know anything about it, when it was all done when I was down there?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.178</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, truly? And you say that by his will——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.179</span><span class="cts_passage">“He leaves me five hundred thousand livres.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.180</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you sure of it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.181</span><span class="cts_passage">“He showed it me; but that is not all—there is a codicil, as I said just now.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.182</span><span class="cts_passage">“Probably.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.183</span><span class="cts_passage">“And in that codicil he acknowledges me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.184</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!” said Caderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.185</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now, say if I conceal anything from you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.186</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your princely father, is he rich, very rich?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.187</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.188</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is it possible?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.189</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is evident enough to me, who am always at his house. The other day a banker’s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.190</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse was filled with wonder; the young man’s words sounded to him like metal, and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.191</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you go into that house?” cried he briskly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.192</span><span class="cts_passage">“When I like.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.193</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse was thoughtful for a moment. It was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind. Then suddenly,—</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.194</span><span class="cts_passage">“How I should like to see all that,” cried he; “how beautiful it must be!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.195</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is, in fact, magnificent,” said Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.196</span><span class="cts_passage">“And does he not live in the Champs-Élysées?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.197</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, No. 30.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.198</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” said Caderousse, “No. 30.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.199</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, a fine house standing alone, between a courtyard and a garden,—you must know it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.200</span><span class="cts_passage">“Possibly; but it is not the exterior I care for, it is the interior. What beautiful furniture there must be in it!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.201</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you ever seen the Tuileries?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.202</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.203</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, it surpasses that.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.204</span><span class="cts_passage">“It must be worth one’s while to stoop, Andrea, when that good M. Monte Cristo lets fall his purse.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.205</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is not worthwhile to wait for that,” said Andrea; “money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.206</span><span class="cts_passage">“But you should take me there one day with you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.207</span><span class="cts_passage">“How can I? On what plea?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.208</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are right; but you have made my mouth water. I must absolutely see it; I shall find a way.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.209</span><span class="cts_passage">“No nonsense, Caderousse!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.210</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will offer myself as floor-polisher.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.211</span><span class="cts_passage">“The rooms are all carpeted.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.212</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, then, I must be contented to imagine it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.213</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is the best plan, believe me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.214</span><span class="cts_passage">“Try, at least, to give me an idea of what it is.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.215</span><span class="cts_passage">“How can I?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.216</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing is easier. Is it large?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.217</span><span class="cts_passage">“Middling.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.218</span><span class="cts_passage">“How is it arranged?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.219</span><span class="cts_passage">“Faith, I should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.220</span><span class="cts_passage">“They are all here,” said Caderousse, briskly. He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink. “Here,” said Caderousse, “draw me all that on the paper, my boy.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.221</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.222</span><span class="cts_passage">“The house, as I said, is between the court and the garden; in this way, do you see?” Andrea drew the garden, the court and the house.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.223</span><span class="cts_passage">“High walls?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.224</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not more than eight or ten feet.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.225</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is not prudent,” said Caderousse.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.226</span><span class="cts_passage">“In the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.227</span><span class="cts_passage">“And no steel-traps?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.228</span><span class="cts_passage">“No.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.229</span><span class="cts_passage">“The stables?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.230</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are on either side of the gate, which you see there.” And Andrea continued his plan.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.231</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let us see the ground floor,” said Caderousse.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.232</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the ground floor, dining-room, two drawing-rooms, billiard-room, staircase in the hall, and a little back staircase.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.233</span><span class="cts_passage">“Windows?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.234</span><span class="cts_passage">“Magnificent windows, so beautiful, so large, that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.235</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.236</span><span class="cts_passage">“Luxury has everything.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.237</span><span class="cts_passage">“But shutters?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.238</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, but they are never used. That Count of Monte Cristo is an original, who loves to look at the sky even at night.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.239</span><span class="cts_passage">“And where do the servants sleep?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.240</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, they have a house to themselves. Picture to yourself a pretty coach-house at the right-hand side where the ladders are kept. Well, over that coach-house are the servants’ rooms, with bells corresponding with the different apartments.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.241</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, _diable!_ bells did you say?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.242</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you mean?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.243</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, nothing! I only say they cost a load of money to hang, and what is the use of them, I should like to know?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.244</span><span class="cts_passage">“There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night, but it has been taken to the house at Auteuil, to that you went to, you know.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.245</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.246</span><span class="cts_passage">“I was saying to him only yesterday, ‘You are imprudent, Monsieur Count; for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected.’ ‘Well,’ said he, ‘what next?’ ‘Well, next, some day you will be robbed.’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.247</span><span class="cts_passage">“What did he answer?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.248</span><span class="cts_passage">“He quietly said, ‘What do I care if I am?’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.249</span><span class="cts_passage">“Andrea, he has some secretaire with a spring.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.250</span><span class="cts_passage">“How do you know?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.251</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune. I was told there were such at the last exhibition.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.252</span><span class="cts_passage">“He has simply a mahogany secretaire, in which the key is always kept.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.253</span><span class="cts_passage">“And he is not robbed?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.254</span><span class="cts_passage">“No; his servants are all devoted to him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.255</span><span class="cts_passage">“There ought to be some money in that secretaire?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.256</span><span class="cts_passage">“There may be. No one knows what there is.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.257</span><span class="cts_passage">“And where is it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.258</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the first floor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.259</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sketch me the plan of that floor, as you have done of the ground floor, my boy.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.260</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is very simple.” Andrea took the pen. “On the first story, do you see, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the drawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a dressing-room. The famous secretaire is in the dressing-room.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.261</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is there a window in the dressing-room?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.262</span><span class="cts_passage">“Two,—one here and one there.” Andrea sketched two windows in the room, which formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom. Caderousse became thoughtful.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.263</span><span class="cts_passage">“Does he often go to Auteuil?” added he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.264</span><span class="cts_passage">“Two or three times a week. Tomorrow, for instance, he is going to spend the day and night there.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.265</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you sure of it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.266</span><span class="cts_passage">“He has invited me to dine there.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.267</span><span class="cts_passage">“There’s a life for you,” said Caderousse; “a town house and a country house.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.268</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is what it is to be rich.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.269</span><span class="cts_passage">“And shall you dine there?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.270</span><span class="cts_passage">“Probably.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.271</span><span class="cts_passage">“When you dine there, do you sleep there?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.272</span><span class="cts_passage">“If I like; I am at home there.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.273</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse looked at the young man, as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart. But Andrea drew a cigar-case from his pocket, took a Havana, quietly lit it, and began smoking.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.274</span><span class="cts_passage">“When do you want your twelve hundred francs?” said he to Caderousse.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.275</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now, if you have them.” Andrea took five-and-twenty louis from his pocket.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.276</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yellow boys?” said Caderousse; “no, I thank you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.277</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, you despise them.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.278</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the contrary, I esteem them, but will not have them.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.279</span><span class="cts_passage">“You can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.280</span><span class="cts_passage">“Exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse, lay hands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold. No nonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them. Anybody may possess a five-franc piece.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.281</span><span class="cts_passage">“But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me? I should want a porter.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.282</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted. I will call for them.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.283</span><span class="cts_passage">“Today?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.284</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, tomorrow; I shall not have time today.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.285</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.286</span><span class="cts_passage">“May I depend on it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.287</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.288</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.289</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now see here, will that be all? Eh? And will you not torment me any more?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.290</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.291</span><span class="cts_passage">Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change. He redoubled his gayety and carelessness.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.292</span><span class="cts_passage">“How sprightly you are,” said Caderousse; “One would say you were already in possession of your property.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.293</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, unfortunately; but when I do obtain it——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.294</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.295</span><span class="cts_passage">“I shall remember old friends, I can tell you that.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.296</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, since you have such a good memory.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.297</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you want? It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.298</span><span class="cts_passage">“I? What an idea! I, who am going to give you another piece of good advice.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.299</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.300</span><span class="cts_passage">“To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger. We shall both get into trouble. You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.301</span><span class="cts_passage">“How so?” said Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.302</span><span class="cts_passage">“How? You put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.303</span><span class="cts_passage">“You guess well.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.304</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know something of diamonds; I have had some.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.305</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do well to boast of it,” said Andrea, who, without becoming angry, as Caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring. Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.306</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is a false diamond,” said Caderousse.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.307</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are joking now,” replied Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.308</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not be angry, we can try it.” Caderousse went to the window, touched the glass with it, and found it would cut.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.309</span><span class="cts_passage">“_Confiteor!_” said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger; “I was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller’s shop—it is another branch of industry paralyzed.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.310</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you finished?” said Andrea,—“do you want anything more?—will you have my waistcoat or my hat? Make free, now you have begun.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.311</span><span class="cts_passage">“No; you are, after all, a good companion; I will not detain you, and will try to cure myself of my ambition.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.312</span><span class="cts_passage">“But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.313</span><span class="cts_passage">“I shall not sell it—do not fear.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.314</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not at least till the day after tomorrow,” thought the young man.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.315</span><span class="cts_passage">“Happy rogue,” said Caderousse; “you are going to find your servants, your horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.316</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Andrea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.317</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.318</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.319</span><span class="cts_passage">“What fortune has she?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.320</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I tell you——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.321</span><span class="cts_passage">“A million?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.322</span><span class="cts_passage">Andrea shrugged his shoulders.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.323</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let it be a million,” said Caderousse; “you can never have so much as I wish you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.324</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thank you,” said the young man.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.325</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, I wish it you with all my heart!” added Caderousse with his hoarse laugh. “Stop, let me show you the way.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.326</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is not worthwhile.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.327</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, it is.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.328</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.329</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because there is a little secret, a precaution I thought it desirable to take, one of Huret & Fichet’s locks, revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.330</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thank you,” said Andrea; “I will let you know a week beforehand.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.331</span><span class="cts_passage">They parted. Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. Then he returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a clever architect, the plan Andrea had left him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81.332</span><span class="cts_passage">“Dear Benedetto,” said he, “I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune, and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend.”</span></div></div>
