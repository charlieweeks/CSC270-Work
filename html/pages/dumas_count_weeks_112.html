			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 113. The Past</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them. A man of the count’s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“I cannot have deceived myself,” he said; “I must look upon the past in a false light. What!” he continued, “can I have been following a false path?—can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?—can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious, undertaking? I cannot reconcile myself to this idea—it would madden me. The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the past. The past, like the country through which we walk, becomes indistinct as we advance. My position is like that of a person wounded in a dream; he feels the wound, though he cannot recollect when he received it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, then, thou regenerate man, thou extravagant prodigal, thou awakened sleeper, thou all-powerful visionary, thou invincible millionaire,—once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness, revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted, and where despair received thee. Too many diamonds, too much gold and splendor, are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantès. Hide thy diamonds, bury thy gold, shroud thy splendor, exchange riches for poverty, liberty for a prison, a living body for a corpse!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.5</span><span class="cts_passage">As he thus reasoned, Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caisserie. It was the same through which, twenty-four years ago, he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard; the houses, today so smiling and animated, were on that night dark, mute, and closed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“And yet they were the same,” murmured Monte Cristo, “only now it is broad daylight instead of night; it is the sun which brightens the place, and makes it appear so cheerful.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.7</span><span class="cts_passage">He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to the Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked. A pleasure-boat with striped awning was going by. Monte Cristo called the owner, who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat. The sun, red and flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean. The sea, smooth as crystal, was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish, which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element; while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen’s boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull, or the merchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.9</span><span class="cts_passage">But notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of Monte Cristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible voyage, the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory. The solitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the Château d’If, which told him whither they were leading him; the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard; his despair when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead—all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up, and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop, so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès. Clear sky, swift-flitting boats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the heavens were hung with black, and the gigantic structure of the Château d’If seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the shore, the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat, and the owner was obliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir, we are at the landing.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he had been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long to Dantès, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.13</span><span class="cts_passage">There had been no prisoners confined in the Château d’If since the revolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for the prevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.14</span><span class="cts_passage">The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there; but they had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other employment. The concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830. He visited his own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had been. Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log of wood.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?” asked the count; “are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes,—in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Monte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost forgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing the brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still seemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the corridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Would you like to hear the story, sir?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; relate it,” said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“This dungeon,” said the concierge, “was, it appears, some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of industry. Another person was confined in the Château at the same time, but he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, indeed?—mad!” repeated Monte Cristo; “and what was his mania?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“He offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Monte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there was a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the treasures.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Could the prisoners see each other?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance of the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“And which of them made this passage?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and industrious, while the abbé was aged and weak; besides, his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“Blind fools!” murmured the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by what means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work. Do you see it?” and the man held the torch to the wall.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, yes; I see,” said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how long they did so, nobody knows. One day the old man fell ill and died. Now guess what the young one did?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“Tell me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the entrance, and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body. Did you ever hear of such an idea?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Monte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas, yet moist with the cold dews of death, had touched his face.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.35</span><span class="cts_passage">The jailer continued:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now this was his project. He fancied that they buried the dead at the Château d’If, and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Château frustrated his projects. They never buried the dead; they merely attached a heavy cannon-ball to the feet, and then threw them into the sea. This is what was done. The young man was thrown from the top of the rock; the corpse was found on the bed next day, and the whole truth was guessed, for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before, that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep, they heard a shriek, which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.37</span><span class="cts_passage">The count breathed with difficulty; the cold drops ran down his forehead, and his heart was full of anguish.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“No,” he muttered, “the doubt I felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts for vengeance. And the prisoner,” he continued aloud, “was he ever heard of afterwards?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, no; of course not. You can understand that one of two things must have happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow, from a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he must have fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom, where he remained—poor fellow!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then you pity him?” said the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“_Ma foi_, yes; though he was in his own element.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you mean?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined for plotting with the Bonapartists.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“Great is truth,” muttered the count, “fire cannot burn, nor water drown it! Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner, and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep.” Then, the count added aloud, “Was his name ever known?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, yes; but only as No. 34.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, Villefort, Villefort,” murmured the count, “this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you wish to see anything more, sir?” said the concierge.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbé’s room.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! No. 27.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; No. 27.” repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, sir.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“Wait,” said Monte Cristo, “I wish to take one final glance around this room.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“This is fortunate,” said the guide; “I have forgotten the other key.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go and fetch it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will leave you the torch, sir.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, take it away; I can see in the dark.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why, you are like No. 34. They said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“He spent fourteen years to arrive at that,” muttered the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.59</span><span class="cts_passage">The guide carried away the torch. The count had spoken correctly. Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed, ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight. Then he looked around him, and really recognized his dungeon.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” he said, “there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall. Oh, those figures, how well I remember them! I made them one day to calculate the age of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still living, and that of Mercédès, to know if I should find her still free. After finishing that calculation, I had a minute’s hope. I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity!” and a bitter laugh escaped the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.61</span><span class="cts_passage">He saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of Mercédès. On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription, the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“‘_Oh, God!_’” he read, “‘_preserve my memory!_’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, yes,” he cried, “that was my only prayer at last; I no longer begged for liberty, but memory; I dreaded to become mad and forgetful. Oh, God, thou hast preserved my memory; I thank thee, I thank thee!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.64</span><span class="cts_passage">At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall; the guide was coming; Monte Cristo went to meet him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“Follow me, sir;” and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance. There, again, Monte Cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts. The first thing that met his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbé on the wall, by which he calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died. The sight of this, instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“This is where the mad abbé was kept, sir, and that is where the young man entered;” and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained unclosed. “From the appearance of the stone,” he continued, “a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years. Poor things! Those must have been ten weary years.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.67</span><span class="cts_passage">Dantès took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him. The guide took them, thinking them merely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch revealed their true worth.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” he said, “you have made a mistake; you have given me gold.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.70</span><span class="cts_passage">The concierge looked upon the count with surprise.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” he cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune—“sir, I cannot understand your generosity!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, it is very simple, my good fellow; I have been a sailor, and your story touched me more than it would others.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“What have you to offer to me, my friend? Shells? Straw-work? Thank you!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Really? What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen,” said the guide; “I said to myself, ‘Something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years,’ so I began to sound the wall.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbé’s two hiding-places.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“After some search, I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed, and at the hearth.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said the count, “yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“I raised the stones, and found——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.82</span><span class="cts_passage">“A rope-ladder and some tools?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.83</span><span class="cts_passage">“How do you know that?” asked the guide in astonishment.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not know—I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners’ cells.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“And have you them yet?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.87</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, sir; I sold them to visitors, who considered them great curiosities; but I have still something left.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” asked the count, impatiently.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“A sort of book, written upon strips of cloth.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.90</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do well.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.91</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will run for it, sir;” and the guide went out.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.92</span><span class="cts_passage">Then the count knelt down by the side of the bed, which death had converted into an altar.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.93</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, second father,” he exclaimed, “thou who hast given me liberty, knowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to ourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,—then, noble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me some sign, some revelation! Remove from me the remains of doubt, which, if it change not to conviction, must become remorse!” The count bowed his head, and clasped his hands together.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here, sir,” said a voice behind him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.95</span><span class="cts_passage">Monte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The manuscript was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the kingdoms of Italy. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph, and he read:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” he exclaimed, “here is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks.” And feeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which contained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000 francs.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.98</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here,” he said, “take this pocket-book.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you give it to me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.100</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;” and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the corridor, and reaching his boat, cried, “To Marseilles!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.101</span><span class="cts_passage">Then, as he departed, he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.102</span><span class="cts_passage">“Woe,” he cried, “to those who confined me in that wretched prison; and woe to those who forgot that I was there!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.103</span><span class="cts_passage">As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman. The victory was complete; twice he had overcome his doubts. The name he pronounced, in a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love, was that of Haydée.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.104</span><span class="cts_passage">On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure of finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a tomb, and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions, had been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from hunger. Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had fallen down and the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old wood in the churchyard.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.105</span><span class="cts_passage">The worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the arms of his children, he had been by them laid by the side of his wife, who had preceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of marble, on which were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a little enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees. Morrel was leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves. His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“Maximilian,” said the count, “you should not look on the graves, but there;” and he pointed upwards.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.107</span><span class="cts_passage">“The dead are everywhere,” said Morrel; “did you not yourself tell me so as we left Paris?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.108</span><span class="cts_passage">“Maximilian,” said the count, “you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at Marseilles. Do you still wish to do so?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.109</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with me, do I not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.111</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, count, I shall forget it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor, Morrel, because you have taken an oath, and are about to do so again.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.113</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, count, have pity upon me. I am so unhappy.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.114</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.115</span><span class="cts_passage">“Impossible!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.117</span><span class="cts_passage">“What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.118</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman. He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed bride whom he adored. He was about to marry her, when one of the caprices of fate,—which would almost make us doubt the goodness of Providence, if that Providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end,—one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress, of the future of which he had dreamed (for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present), and cast him into a dungeon.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.119</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” said Morrel, “one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.120</span><span class="cts_passage">“He remained there fourteen years, Morrel,” said the count, placing his hand on the young man’s shoulder. Maximilian shuddered.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fourteen years!” he muttered.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.122</span><span class="cts_passage">“Fourteen years!” repeated the count. “During that time he had many moments of despair. He also, Morrel, like you, considered himself the unhappiest of men.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well?” asked Morrel.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.124</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human means. At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the Lord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he miraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first cry was for his father; but that father was dead.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“My father, too, is dead,” said Morrel.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and full of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of Providence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his tomb had disappeared, and no one could say, ‘There sleeps the father you so well loved.’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.127</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh!” exclaimed Morrel.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.128</span><span class="cts_passage">“He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not even find his father’s grave.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.129</span><span class="cts_passage">“But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.130</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are deceived, Morrel, that woman——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.131</span><span class="cts_passage">“She was dead?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.132</span><span class="cts_passage">“Worse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more unhappy lover than you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.133</span><span class="cts_passage">“And has he found consolation?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.134</span><span class="cts_passage">“He has at least found peace.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.135</span><span class="cts_passage">“And does he ever expect to be happy?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.136</span><span class="cts_passage">“He hopes so, Maximilian.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.137</span><span class="cts_passage">The young man’s head fell on his breast.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.138</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have my promise,” he said, after a minute’s pause, extending his hand to Monte Cristo. “Only remember——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.139</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of Monte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of Bastia, it will be called the _Eurus_. You will give your name to the captain, who will bring you to me. It is understood—is it not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.140</span><span class="cts_passage">“But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.141</span><span class="cts_passage">“Child,” replied the count, “not to know the value of a man’s word! I have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day, I will assist you. Morrel, farewell!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.142</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you leave me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.143</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; I have business in Italy. I leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune—alone with that strong-winged eagle which God sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet. The story of Ganymede, Maximilian, is not a fable, but an allegory.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.144</span><span class="cts_passage">“When do you leave?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.145</span><span class="cts_passage">“Immediately; the steamer waits, and in an hour I shall be far from you. Will you accompany me to the harbor, Maximilian?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.146</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am entirely yours, count.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">113.147</span><span class="cts_passage">Morrel accompanied the count to the harbor. The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney. The steamer soon disappeared, and in an hour afterwards, as the count had said, was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night.</span></div></div>
