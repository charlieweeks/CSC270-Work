			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 71. Bread and Salt</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.2</span><span class="cts_passage">Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion. It led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?” she asked.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds.” As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of Mercédès tremble. “But you,” he said, “with that light dress, and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel cold?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know where I am leading you?” said the countess, without replying to the question.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but you see I make no resistance.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her, but she continued to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They reached the building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun, so frequently absent in our climate. The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“See, count,” she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids—“see, our French grapes are not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you will make allowance for our northern sun.” The count bowed, but stepped back.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you refuse?” said Mercédès, in a tremulous voice.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Pray excuse me, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “but I never eat Muscatel grapes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.12</span><span class="cts_passage">Mercédès let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat. Mercédès drew near, and plucked the fruit.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take this peach, then,” she said. The count again refused. “What, again?” she exclaimed, in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob; “really, you pain me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.14</span><span class="cts_passage">A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the ground.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Count,” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance, “there is a beautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know it, madame,” replied the count; “but we are in France, and not in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“But,” said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, “we are friends, are we not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.18</span><span class="cts_passage">The count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then again rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly, we are friends,” he replied; “why should we not be?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired, that she turned away to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more like a groan. “Thank you,” she said. And they walked on again. They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” suddenly exclaimed the countess, after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence, “is it true that you have seen so much, travelled so far, and suffered so deeply?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have suffered deeply, madame,” answered Monte Cristo.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“But now you are happy?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Doubtless,” replied the count, “since no one hears me complain.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“My present happiness equals my past misery,” said the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you not married?” asked the countess.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“I, married?” exclaimed Monte Cristo, shuddering; “who could have told you so?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely woman.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the daughter of a prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one else to love in the world.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“You live alone, then?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have no sister—no son—no father?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have no one.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the point of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my memory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have done in my place; that is all.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.37</span><span class="cts_passage">The countess stopped for a moment, as if gasping for breath. “Yes,” she said, “and you have still preserved this love in your heart—one can only love once—and did you ever see her again?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“I never returned to the country where she lived.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“To Malta?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; Malta.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“She is, then, now at Malta?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“I think so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Her,—yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“But only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“I hate them? Not at all; why should I?” The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Take some,” she said.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Madame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,” replied Monte Cristo, as if the subject had not been mentioned before. The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket, with a gesture of despair.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Inflexible man!” she murmured. Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.52</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert at this moment ran in. “Oh, mother,” he exclaimed, “such a misfortune has happened!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“What? What has happened?” asked the countess, as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life; “did you say a misfortune? Indeed, I should expect misfortunes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“M. de Villefort is here.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“He comes to fetch his wife and daughter.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why so?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because Madame de Saint-Méran is just arrived in Paris, bringing the news of M. de Saint-Méran’s death, which took place on the first stage after he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but Mademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth, notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her like a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“And how was M. de Saint-Méran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?” said the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“He was her grandfather on the mother’s side. He was coming here to hasten her marriage with Franz.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, indeed!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“So Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-Méran also grandfather to Mademoiselle Danglars?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“Albert, Albert,” said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof, “what are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly, tell him that he has spoken amiss.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.64</span><span class="cts_passage">And she took two or three steps forward. Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful, and so full of affectionate admiration, that she turned back and grasped his hand; at the same time she seized that of her son, and joined them together.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“We are friends; are we not?” she asked.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all times I am your most respectful servant.” The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not my mother and you agree?” asked Albert, astonished.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the contrary,” replied the count, “did you not hear her declare that we were friends?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71.69</span><span class="cts_passage">They re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and Madame de Villefort had just quitted. It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel departed almost at the same time.</span></div></div>
