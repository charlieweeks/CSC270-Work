			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.2</span><span class="cts_passage">If Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even she would have been constrained to pity him. Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his study, where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.3</span><span class="cts_passage">“After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of M. Franz d’Épinay. M. d’Épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not have anticipated him in this announcement.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.4</span><span class="cts_passage">No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history. And in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier, who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always omitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life entertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d’Épinay, as he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been conferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was killed fairly in a duel. This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.5</span><span class="cts_passage">Hardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. The sudden departure of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much astonished everyone, that the position of Madame de Villefort, left alone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more embarrassing. Determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the room; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.6</span><span class="cts_passage">M. de Villefort’s communications on the subject were very limited and concise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place between M. Noirtier, M. d’Épinay, and himself, and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off. This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting. She therefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit, the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer. This news, false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred, evidently astonished the auditors, and they retired without a word.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.7</span><span class="cts_passage">During this time Valentine, at once terrified and happy, after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked leave to retire to her own room, in order to recover her composure. Noirtier looked the permission which she solicited. But instead of going to her own room, Valentine, having once gained her liberty, entered the gallery, and, opening a small door at the end of it, found herself at once in the garden.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.8</span><span class="cts_passage">In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentine’s mind. She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear, pale and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract, like the Laird of Ravenswood in _The Bride of Lammermoor_.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.9</span><span class="cts_passage">It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate, for Maximilian had long awaited her coming. He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M. de Villefort. He followed M. d’Épinay, saw him enter, afterwards go out, and then re-enter with Albert and Château-Renaud. He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover-patch, prepared to hear the result of the proceedings, and very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty. He was not mistaken; peering through the crevices of the wooden partition, he soon discovered the young girl, who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier. The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him, and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“We are saved!” said Valentine.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“Saved?” repeated Morrel, not being able to conceive such intense happiness; “by whom?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“By my grandfather. Oh, Morrel, pray love him for all his goodness to us!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father, he worshiped him as a god.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“But tell me, Valentine, how has it all been effected? What strange means has he used to compass this blessed end?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“At some future time I will tell you all about it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“But when will that be?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“When I am your wife.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.19</span><span class="cts_passage">The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel, that he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day. However, he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night. Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.20</span><span class="cts_passage">During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame de Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine’s marriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was concluded.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier’s countenance remained immovable.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware; that is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an explanation.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked, is done away with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“I come to entreat you, sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, “as the only one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—I come to entreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always possessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.28</span><span class="cts_passage">There was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not succeed in doing so.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “that your intentions accord with my request?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Noirtier made a sign that they did.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“In that case, sir,” rejoined Madame de Villefort, “I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes.” She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.32</span><span class="cts_passage">The next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn up and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. It was then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of Saint-Méran, had regained the good graces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300,000 livres.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.33</span><span class="cts_passage">While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de Villefort, Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf, who, in order to lose no time in responding to M. Danglars’ wishes, and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society, donned his uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all his crosses, and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first sight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled himself in his easy-chair.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Morcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to the point.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, baron,” said he, “here I am at last; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.37</span><span class="cts_passage">Morcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it grew darker and darker.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“To what do you allude, monsieur?” said Danglars; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general’s words.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” said Morcerf, “I see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir, and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted. _Ma foi_, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.40</span><span class="cts_passage">And Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars, said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“Baron, I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.42</span><span class="cts_passage">But Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“To reflect?” said Morcerf, more and more astonished; “have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.45</span><span class="cts_passage">“Count,” said the banker, “things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not understand you, baron,” said Morcerf.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“What I mean to say is this, sir,—that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“Excuse me,” said Morcerf, “but is it a play we are acting?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“A play?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is quite my desire.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“I see him very often,” said Danglars, drawing himself up; “he is a particular friend of mine.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did you not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“I did say so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.57</span><span class="cts_passage">Danglars did not answer.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“Have you so soon changed your mind,” added Morcerf, “or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.59</span><span class="cts_passage">Danglars, seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“Count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but, believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,” said Morcerf: “they might satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to him his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.62</span><span class="cts_passage">Danglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am not without a good reason for my conduct,” replied the banker.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do you mean to say?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“I mean to say that I have a good reason, but that it is difficult to explain.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“You must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at least is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my family.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, sir,” said Danglars; “I merely suspend my decision, that is all.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.70</span><span class="cts_passage">The count bit his lips till the blood almost started, to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain; understanding, however, that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him, he turned from the door, towards which he had been directing his steps, and again confronted the banker. A cloud settled on his brow, evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness, instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“My dear Danglars,” said Morcerf, “we have been acquainted for many years, and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other’s failings. You owe me an explanation, and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount, that is all I can say, sir,” replied Danglars, who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed down.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“And towards whom do you bear this personal ill-feeling, then?” said Morcerf, turning pale with anger. The expression of the count’s face had not remained unperceived by the banker; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before, and said:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“You may, perhaps, be better satisfied that I should not go farther into particulars.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.75</span><span class="cts_passage">A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count, and making a violent effort over himself, he said: “I have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation. Is it Madame de Morcerf who has displeased you? Is it my fortune which you find insufficient? Is it because my opinions differ from yours?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nothing of the kind, sir,” replied Danglars: “if such had been the case, I only should have been to blame, inasmuch as I was aware of all these things when I made the engagement. No, do not seek any longer to discover the reason. I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self-examination; let us drop the subject, and adopt the middle course of delay, which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement. _Ma foi_, there is no hurry. My daughter is only seventeen years old, and your son twenty-one. While we wait, time will be progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in the evening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light of morning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a single day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“Calumnies, did you say, sir?” cried Morcerf, turning livid with rage. “Does anyone dare to slander me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“Monsieur, I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explanation.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir, although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive, for I had reckoned on the honor of your alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“Enough, sir,” said Morcerf, “we will speak no more on the subject.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.82</span><span class="cts_passage">And clutching his gloves in anger, he left the apartment. Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.83</span><span class="cts_passage">That evening he had a long conference with several friends; and M. Cavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies, was the last to leave the banker’s house.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.84</span><span class="cts_passage">The next morning, as soon as he awoke, Danglars asked for the newspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and at last fixed on _l’Impartial_, the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief editor. He hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with nervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings, and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious smile, at a paragraph headed</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.85</span><span class="cts_passage">_We hear from Yanina._</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“Very good,” observed Danglars, after having read the paragraph; “here is a little article on Colonel Fernand, which, if I am not mistaken, would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.87</span><span class="cts_passage">At the same moment, that is, at nine o’clock in the morning, Albert de Morcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristo’s house in the Champs-Élysées. When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour previously.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did he take Baptistin with him?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, my lord.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.90</span><span class="cts_passage">“Call him, then; I wish to speak to him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.91</span><span class="cts_passage">The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre, and returned with him in an instant.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“My good friend,” said Albert, “I beg pardon for my intrusion, but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.93</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is really out, sir,” replied Baptistin.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“Out, even to me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.95</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte,” said Baptistin; “and I should therefore never think of including him in any general order.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are right; and now I wish to see him on an affair of great importance. Do you think it will be long before he comes in?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, I think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o’clock.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.98</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I will go and take a turn in the Champs-Élysées, and at ten o’clock I will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in, will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“You may depend on my doing so, sir,” said Baptistin.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.100</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert left the cab in which he had come at the count’s door, intending to take a turn on foot. As he was passing the Allée des Veuves, he thought he saw the count’s horses standing at Gosset’s shooting-gallery; he approached, and soon recognized the coachman.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.101</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is the count shooting in the gallery?” said Morcerf.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.102</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, sir,” replied the coachman. While he was speaking, Albert had heard the report of two or three pistol-shots. He entered, and on his way met the waiter.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“Excuse me, my lord,” said the lad; “but will you have the kindness to wait a moment?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.104</span><span class="cts_passage">“What for, Philip?” asked Albert, who, being a constant visitor there, did not understand this opposition to his entrance.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.105</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone, and never practices in the presence of anyone.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not even before you, Philip? Then who loads his pistol?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.107</span><span class="cts_passage">“His servant.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.108</span><span class="cts_passage">“A Nubian?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.109</span><span class="cts_passage">“A negro.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“It is he, then.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.111</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you know this gentleman?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, and I am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.113</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, that is quite another thing, then. I will go immediately and inform him of your arrival.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.114</span><span class="cts_passage">And Philip, urged by his own curiosity, entered the gallery; a second afterwards, Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.115</span><span class="cts_passage">“I ask your pardon, my dear count,” said Albert, “for following you here, and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so; I alone am to blame for the indiscretion. I went to your house, and they told me you were out, but that they expected you home at ten o’clock to breakfast. I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o’clock, when I caught sight of your carriage and horses.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.117</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, thank you, I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.118</span><span class="cts_passage">“What on earth are you talking of?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.119</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am to fight today.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.120</span><span class="cts_passage">“For what?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“For the sake of fighting!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.122</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, I understand that, but what is the quarrel? People fight for all sorts of reasons, you know.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“I fight in the cause of honor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.124</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, that is something serious.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“So serious, that I come to beg you to render me a service.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.127</span><span class="cts_passage">“To be my second.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.128</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is a serious matter, and we will not discuss it here; let us speak of nothing till we get home. Ali, bring me some water.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.129</span><span class="cts_passage">The count turned up his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.130</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come in, my lord,” said Philip in a low tone, “and I will show you something droll.” Morcerf entered, and in place of the usual target, he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall. At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.131</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, ha,” said Albert, “I see you were preparing for a game of cards.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.132</span><span class="cts_passage">“No,” said the count, “I was making a suit.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.133</span><span class="cts_passage">“How?” said Albert.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.134</span><span class="cts_passage">“Those are really aces and twos which you see, but my shots have turned them into threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines, and tens.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.135</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert approached. In fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied, the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil. In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count’s pistol.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.136</span><span class="cts_passage">“_Diable!_” said Morcerf.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.137</span><span class="cts_passage">“What would you have, my dear viscount?” said Monte Cristo, wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him; “I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other. But come, I am waiting for you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.138</span><span class="cts_passage">Both men entered Monte Cristo’s carriage, which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No. 30. Monte Cristo took Albert into his study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. “Now let us talk the matter over quietly,” said the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.139</span><span class="cts_passage">“You see I am perfectly composed,” said Albert.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.140</span><span class="cts_passage">“With whom are you going to fight?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.141</span><span class="cts_passage">“With Beauchamp.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.142</span><span class="cts_passage">“One of your friends!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.143</span><span class="cts_passage">“Of course; it is always with friends that one fights.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.144</span><span class="cts_passage">“I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.145</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.146</span><span class="cts_passage">“What has he done to you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.147</span><span class="cts_passage">“There appeared in his journal last night—but wait, and read for yourself.” And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as follows:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.148</span><span class="cts_passage">“A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.149</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “what do you see in that to annoy you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.150</span><span class="cts_passage">“What do I see in it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.151</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.152</span><span class="cts_passage">“It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name is Fernand!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.153</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did your father serve under Ali Pasha?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.154</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks, and hence arises the calumny.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.155</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.156</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not desire to do otherwise.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.157</span><span class="cts_passage">“Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and who cares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.158</span><span class="cts_passage">“That just shows the meanness of this slander. They have allowed all this time to elapse, and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal, in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position. I inherit my father’s name, and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it. I am going to Beauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.159</span><span class="cts_passage">“Beauchamp will never retract.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.160</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then we must fight.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.161</span><span class="cts_passage">“No you will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.162</span><span class="cts_passage">“We will fight, nevertheless. I will efface that blot on my father’s character. My father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so brilliant——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.163</span><span class="cts_passage">“Oh, well, he will add, ‘We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf, who also bears the same Christian name.’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.164</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.165</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.166</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.167</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do wrong.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.168</span><span class="cts_passage">“Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.169</span><span class="cts_passage">“You know my theory regarding duels; I told you my opinion on that subject, if you remember, when we were at Rome.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.170</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nevertheless, my dear count, I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.171</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be eccentric. If one’s lot is cast among fools, it is necessary to study folly. I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp, who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other, he will bring his witnesses, or will insult me in some public place, and I am expected to kill him for all that.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.172</span><span class="cts_passage">“You admit that you would fight, then? Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.173</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not say that you ought not to fight, I only say that a duel is a serious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.174</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did he reflect before he insulted my father?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.175</span><span class="cts_passage">“If he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be satisfied.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.176</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.177</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you are far too exacting. Supposing, for instance, and do not be angry at what I am going to say——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.178</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.179</span><span class="cts_passage">“Supposing the assertion to be really true?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.180</span><span class="cts_passage">“A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father’s honor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.181</span><span class="cts_passage">“_Ma foi!_ we live in times when there is much to which we must submit.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.182</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is precisely the fault of the age.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.183</span><span class="cts_passage">“And do you undertake to reform it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.184</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, as far as I am personally concerned.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.185</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.186</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, I own it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.187</span><span class="cts_passage">“Are you quite impervious to good advice?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.188</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not when it comes from a friend.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.189</span><span class="cts_passage">“And do you account me that title?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.190</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly I do.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.191</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, then, before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses, seek further information on the subject.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.192</span><span class="cts_passage">“From whom?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.193</span><span class="cts_passage">“From Haydée.”</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.198</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do—most decidedly.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.199</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then let me offer one more word of advice.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.200</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do so, then, but let it be the last.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.201</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.202</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the contrary, I request it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.203</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp—visit him alone.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.204</span><span class="cts_passage">“That would be contrary to all custom.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.205</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your case is not an ordinary one.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.206</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what is your reason for advising me to go alone?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.207</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.208</span><span class="cts_passage">“Explain yourself.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.209</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will do so. If Beauchamp be disposed to retract, you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will,—the satisfaction to you will be the same. If, on the contrary, he refuses to do so, it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.210</span><span class="cts_passage">“They will not be strangers, they will be friends.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.211</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow; Beauchamp, for instance.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.212</span><span class="cts_passage">“So you recommend——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.213</span><span class="cts_passage">“I recommend you to be prudent.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.214</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.215</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do, and I will tell you why. When you wish to obtain some concession from a man’s self-love, you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.216</span><span class="cts_passage">“I believe you are right.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.217</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am glad of it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.218</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then I will go alone.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.219</span><span class="cts_passage">“Go; but you would do better still by not going at all.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.220</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is impossible.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.221</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed.”</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.224</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.225</span><span class="cts_passage">“Perhaps you may know at some future period, and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.226</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, I will have Franz and Château-Renaud; they will be the very men for it.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.227</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do so, then.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.228</span><span class="cts_passage">“But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?”</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.232</span><span class="cts_passage">“We will say no more about it, then. Good-bye, count.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.233</span><span class="cts_passage">Morcerf took his hat, and left the room. He found his carriage at the door, and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp, who was in his office. It was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as journalists’ offices have always been from time immemorial. The servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf. Beauchamp repeated the name to himself, as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then gave orders for him to be admitted. Albert entered.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.234</span><span class="cts_passage">Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.235</span><span class="cts_passage">“This way, this way, my dear Albert!” said he, holding out his hand to the young man. “Are you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me? Try and find a seat—there is one by that geranium, which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.236</span><span class="cts_passage">“Beauchamp,” said Albert, “it is of your journal that I come to speak.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.237</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed? What do you wish to say about it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.238</span><span class="cts_passage">“I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.239</span><span class="cts_passage">“To what do you refer? But pray sit down.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.240</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thank you,” said Albert, with a cold and formal bow.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.241</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.242</span><span class="cts_passage">“An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.243</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is it?” said Beauchamp, much surprised; “surely you must be mistaken.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.244</span><span class="cts_passage">“The story sent you from Yanina.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.245</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yanina?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.246</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.247</span><span class="cts_passage">“Such is really the case, I assure you, upon my honor! Baptiste, give me yesterday’s paper,” cried Beauchamp.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.248</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here, I have brought mine with me,” replied Albert.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.249</span><span class="cts_passage">Beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undertone.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.250</span><span class="cts_passage">“You see it is a serious annoyance,” said Morcerf, when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.251</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is the officer referred to a relation of yours, then?” demanded the journalist.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.252</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” said Albert, blushing.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.253</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, what do you wish me to do for you?” said Beauchamp mildly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.254</span><span class="cts_passage">“My dear Beauchamp, I wish you to contradict this statement.” Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.255</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come,” said he, “this matter will want a good deal of talking over; a retractation is always a serious thing, you know. Sit down, and I will read it again.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.256</span><span class="cts_passage">Albert resumed his seat, and Beauchamp read, with more attention than at first, the lines denounced by his friend.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.257</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Albert in a determined tone, “you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family, and I insist on a retractation being made.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.258</span><span class="cts_passage">“You insist?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.259</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, I insist.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.260</span><span class="cts_passage">“Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear viscount.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.261</span><span class="cts_passage">“Nor do I wish to be there,” replied the young man, rising. “I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted. You have known me long enough,” continued Albert, biting his lips convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp’s anger was beginning to rise,—“you have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this point.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.262</span><span class="cts_passage">“If I have been your friend, Morcerf, your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title. But wait a moment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. You are irritated and vexed—tell me how this Fernand is related to you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.263</span><span class="cts_passage">“He is merely my father,” said Albert—“M. Fernand Mondego, Count of Morcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.264</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is it your father?” said Beauchamp; “that is quite another thing. Then I can well understand your indignation, my dear Albert. I will look at it again;” and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a stress on each word as he proceeded. “But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.265</span><span class="cts_passage">“No; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will have the article contradicted.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.266</span><span class="cts_passage">At the words _I will_, Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Albert’s countenance, and then as gradually lowering them, he remained thoughtful for a few moments.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.267</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will retract this assertion, will you not, Beauchamp?” said Albert with increased though stifled anger.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.268</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” replied Beauchamp.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.269</span><span class="cts_passage">“Immediately?” said Albert.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.270</span><span class="cts_passage">“When I am convinced that the statement is false.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.271</span><span class="cts_passage">“What?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.272</span><span class="cts_passage">“The thing is worth looking into, and I will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.273</span><span class="cts_passage">“But what is there to investigate, sir?” said Albert, enraged beyond measure at Beauchamp’s last remark. “If you do not believe that it is my father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it to be him, state your reasons for doing so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.274</span><span class="cts_passage">Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him, and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.275</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” replied he, “if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction, you should have gone at once to the point, and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half hour. Am I to put this construction on your visit?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.276</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.277</span><span class="cts_passage">“Wait a moment—no threats, if you please, M. Fernand Mondego, Vicomte de Morcerf; I never allow them from my enemies, and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends. You insist on my contradicting the article relating to General Fernand, an article with which, I assure you on my word of honor, I had nothing whatever to do?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.278</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, I insist on it,” said Albert, whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.279</span><span class="cts_passage">“And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?” said Beauchamp in a calm tone.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.280</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes,” replied Albert, raising his voice.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.281</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well,” said Beauchamp, “here is my answer, my dear sir. The article was not inserted by me—I was not even aware of it; but you have, by the step you have taken, called my attention to the paragraph in question, and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.282</span><span class="cts_passage">“Sir,” said Albert, rising, “I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you, and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.283</span><span class="cts_passage">“Certainly, my dear sir.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.284</span><span class="cts_passage">“And this evening, if you please, or tomorrow at the latest, we will meet.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.285</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, no, I will be on the ground at the proper time; but in my opinion (and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries, as it is I who have received the provocation)—in my opinion the time ought not to be yet. I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword, while I am only moderately so; I know, too, that you are a good marksman—there we are about equal. I know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair, because you are brave, and I am brave also. I do not therefore wish either to kill you, or to be killed myself without a cause. Now, I am going to put a question to you, and one very much to the purpose too. Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor, that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.286</span><span class="cts_passage">“I maintain my original resolution.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.287</span><span class="cts_passage">“Very well, my dear sir; then I consent to cut throats with you. But I require three weeks’ preparation; at the end of that time I shall come and say to you, ‘The assertion is false, and I retract it,’ or ‘The assertion is true,’ when I shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath, or the pistols from the case, whichever you please.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.288</span><span class="cts_passage">“Three weeks!” cried Albert; “they will pass as slowly as three centuries when I am all the time suffering dishonor.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.289</span><span class="cts_passage">“Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me, I should have said, ‘Patience, my friend;’ but you have constituted yourself my enemy, therefore I say, ‘What does that signify to me, sir?’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.290</span><span class="cts_passage">“Well, let it be three weeks then,” said Morcerf; “but remember, at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.291</span><span class="cts_passage">“M. Albert de Morcerf,” said Beauchamp, rising in his turn, “I cannot throw you out of window for three weeks—that is to say, for twenty-four days to come—nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed. Today is the 29th of August; the 21st of September will, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed on, and till that time arrives—and it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to give you—till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.292</span><span class="cts_passage">When he had concluded his speech, Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert, turned his back upon him, and went to the press-room. Albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers, which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick; after which ebullition he departed—not, however, without walking several times to the door of the press-room, as if he had half a mind to enter.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.293</span><span class="cts_passage">While Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture, as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel, who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye. He was passing the Chinese Baths, and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte Saint-Martin, and to be going towards the Madeleine.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78.294</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah,” said Morcerf, “there goes a happy man!” And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his opinion.</span></div></div>
