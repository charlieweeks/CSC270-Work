			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.1</span><span class="cts_passage">Chapter 68. A Summer Ball</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.2</span><span class="cts_passage">The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed through the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the door was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son’s arm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his toilet, drove to the Champs-Élysées, to the house of Monte Cristo.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.3</span><span class="cts_passage">The count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man’s favor. Those who would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his invariable practice.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.4</span><span class="cts_passage">“Here I am, dear count.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.5</span><span class="cts_passage">“Welcome home again.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.6</span><span class="cts_passage">“I arrived an hour since.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.7</span><span class="cts_passage">“From Dieppe?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.8</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, from Tréport.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.9</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.10</span><span class="cts_passage">“And I have come at once to see you.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.11</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is extremely kind of you,” said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect indifference.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.12</span><span class="cts_passage">“And what is the news?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.13</span><span class="cts_passage">“You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.14</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.15</span><span class="cts_passage">“Had you commissioned me?” said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.16</span><span class="cts_passage">“Come, come,” said Albert, “do not assume so much indifference. It is said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I felt the electric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.17</span><span class="cts_passage">“Possibly,” said Monte Cristo, “I have indeed thought of you, but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.18</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed! Pray tell me how it happened.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.19</span><span class="cts_passage">“Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.20</span><span class="cts_passage">“I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.21</span><span class="cts_passage">“But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.22</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your Italian prince?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.23</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.24</span><span class="cts_passage">“Calls himself, do you say?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.25</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, calls himself.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.26</span><span class="cts_passage">“Is he not a count?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.27</span><span class="cts_passage">“What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him the same title, and everyone else does likewise.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.28</span><span class="cts_passage">“What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined here?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.29</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars, M. and Madame de Villefort,—charming people,—M. Debray, Maximilian Morrel, and M. de Château-Renaud.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.30</span><span class="cts_passage">“Did they speak of me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.31</span><span class="cts_passage">“Not a word.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.32</span><span class="cts_passage">“So much the worse.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.33</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.34</span><span class="cts_passage">“If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am in despair.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.35</span><span class="cts_passage">“How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you at home.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.36</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in which I think of her.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.37</span><span class="cts_passage">“Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?” said the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.38</span><span class="cts_passage">“Listen,” said Morcerf—“if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a charming mistress—but a wife—_diable!_”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.39</span><span class="cts_passage">“And this,” said Monte Cristo, “is your opinion of your intended spouse?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.40</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens me. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,—good heavens! There she must always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.41</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are difficult to please, viscount.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.42</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.43</span><span class="cts_passage">“What is that?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.44</span><span class="cts_passage">“To find such a wife as my father found.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.45</span><span class="cts_passage">Monte Cristo turned pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some magnificent pistols.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.46</span><span class="cts_passage">“Your father was fortunate, then?” said he.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.47</span><span class="cts_passage">“You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,—still beautiful, witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at Tréport, it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peaceful—shall I say more poetic!—than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my companion.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.48</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone vow to live a single life.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.49</span><span class="cts_passage">“Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars. Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at Marlé’s or Fossin’s shines with more splendor when it is our own; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and still must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we have to endure?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.50</span><span class="cts_passage">“Worldling,” murmured the count.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.51</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions.” Monte Cristo smiled. “One plan occurred to me,” continued Albert; “Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written in the most alluring style, he invariably answered: ‘My eccentricity may be great, but it will not make me break my promise.’”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.52</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself.” Albert smiled.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.53</span><span class="cts_passage">“Apropos,” continued he, “Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest you; you dislike him, I think?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.54</span><span class="cts_passage">“I?” said Monte Cristo; “my dear viscount, how have you discovered that I did not like M. Franz! I like everyone.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.55</span><span class="cts_passage">“And you include me in the expression everyone—many thanks!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.56</span><span class="cts_passage">“Let us not mistake,” said Monte Cristo; “I love everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly hate but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d’Épinay. Did you say he was coming?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.57</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one’s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.58</span><span class="cts_passage">“But M. d’Épinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.59</span><span class="cts_passage">“Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie, and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and Madame de Villefort.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.60</span><span class="cts_passage">“Which they deserve, do they not?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.61</span><span class="cts_passage">“I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.62</span><span class="cts_passage">“There is, then, one,” said Monte Cristo, “whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.63</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,” replied Albert, laughing.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.64</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed, my dear sir,” said Monte Cristo, “you are revoltingly foppish.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.65</span><span class="cts_passage">“I foppish? how do you mean?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.66</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course; perhaps you may not have to retract.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.67</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bah!” said Albert, staring.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.68</span><span class="cts_passage">“Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.69</span><span class="cts_passage">“I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.70</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.71</span><span class="cts_passage">“Am I, indeed, so happy?” said Albert, who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. “But, my dear count, has M. Danglars any reason?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.72</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah! there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the self-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.73</span><span class="cts_passage">“But yet, M. Danglars appeared——”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.74</span><span class="cts_passage">“Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for yourself.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.75</span><span class="cts_passage">“Thank you, I understand. But my mother—no, not my mother; I mistake—my father intends giving a ball.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.76</span><span class="cts_passage">“A ball at this season?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.77</span><span class="cts_passage">“Summer balls are fashionable.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.78</span><span class="cts_passage">“If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would become so.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.79</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain in Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.80</span><span class="cts_passage">“When will it take place?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.81</span><span class="cts_passage">“On Saturday.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.82</span><span class="cts_passage">“M. Cavalcanti’s father will be gone.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.83</span><span class="cts_passage">“But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.84</span><span class="cts_passage">“I do not know him, viscount.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.85</span><span class="cts_passage">“You do not know him?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.86</span><span class="cts_passage">“No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.87</span><span class="cts_passage">“But you receive him at your house?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.88</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbé, who may be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to present him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you would accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,—besides, I may not be there myself.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.89</span><span class="cts_passage">“Where?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.90</span><span class="cts_passage">“At your ball.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.91</span><span class="cts_passage">“Why should you not be there?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.92</span><span class="cts_passage">“Because you have not yet invited me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.93</span><span class="cts_passage">“But I come expressly for that purpose.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.94</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are very kind, but I may be prevented.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.95</span><span class="cts_passage">“If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.96</span><span class="cts_passage">“Tell me what it is.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.97</span><span class="cts_passage">“My mother begs you to come.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.98</span><span class="cts_passage">“The Comtesse de Morcerf?” said Monte Cristo, starting.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.99</span><span class="cts_passage">“Ah, count,” said Albert, “I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them, for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.100</span><span class="cts_passage">“You have talked of me?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.101</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.102</span><span class="cts_passage">“Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.103</span><span class="cts_passage">“A problem, my dear count, for everyone—for my mother as well as others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do not fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I believe, while the Countess G—— takes you for Lord Ruthven, my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for you, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.104</span><span class="cts_passage">“I thank you for the warning,” said the count; “I shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.105</span><span class="cts_passage">“You will, then, come on Saturday?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.106</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.107</span><span class="cts_passage">“You are very kind.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.108</span><span class="cts_passage">“Will M. Danglars be there?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.109</span><span class="cts_passage">“He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the great d’Aguesseau,11 M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope of seeing him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.110</span><span class="cts_passage">“‘Never despair of anything,’ says the proverb.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.111</span><span class="cts_passage">“Do you dance, count?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.112</span><span class="cts_passage">“I dance?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.113</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.114</span><span class="cts_passage">“That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I like to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.115</span><span class="cts_passage">“Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.116</span><span class="cts_passage">“Indeed?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.117</span><span class="cts_passage">“Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have heard her speak with interest.” Albert rose and took his hat; the count conducted him to the door.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.118</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have one thing to reproach myself with,” said he, stopping Albert on the steps. “What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.119</span><span class="cts_passage">“I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.120</span><span class="cts_passage">“On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.121</span><span class="cts_passage">“I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect M. d’Épinay?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.122</span><span class="cts_passage">“Five or six days hence at the latest.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.123</span><span class="cts_passage">“And when is he to be married?”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.124</span><span class="cts_passage">“Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.125</span><span class="cts_passage">“Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you I shall be happy to see him.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.126</span><span class="cts_passage">“I will obey your orders, my lord.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.127</span><span class="cts_passage">“Good-bye.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">68.128</span><span class="cts_passage">“Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?”</span></div>
